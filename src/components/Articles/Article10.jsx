This is known as The Big Bang Theory. Well, all this happened roughly 13.8 billion years back, no one was alive to testify it for us, but one thing is for sure, to create something as astounding and amazing as our universe you need to start with a bang.",

Though no one knows for sure how many species of plants as well as animals actually exist on Earth. In fact, some 10,000 species of animals are discovered each year, with over one and a half million species already described. In short nature loves variety!!",

Students listened to audio recordings of dogs barking, watched silent videos of a basketball game, and touched and held common objects blocked from view, such as a coffee mug. The researchers found that between an hour and a week later, students were worse at remembering the sounds they had heard, but their memory for visual scenes and tactile objects was about the same.",

Paddy requires more water than any other crop. As a result, paddy cultivation is done only in those areas where minimum rainfall is 115 cm. Although the regions are having average annual rainfall between 175—300 cm are the most suitable. Extreme rainfall variability triggers environmental problems such as flood, gully erosion, drought and desertification, which have serious effect on the yield of rice.

Knowing where to take a pause can create an impact that you have never seen before.
